1.Select the right University for your Post-Grad program. Categorise universities for consideration into these 3 groups (a. Ambitious - typically an Ivy League, b.On-Par - these are the schools that your academic grade level will get you into, c. Safe Schools - these schools are where you can easily get into). Apply to as many as you can, and apply early, possibly well before the admission cycle.
2. Course Selection: Don't be limited by a particular region as certain courses can sometimes be broadly embedded within departments.
3. Research Universities - Find as many schools, keep a spreadsheet if that helps you track your applications. 
4. Reach out - Connect with various universities if you have questions/enquiries (on fees, course, funding etc)
5. Create an application package (the major docs; personal cv, transcript, SOP, reference letter) and customise each application for each uni.
